I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Tepper School of Business at 
Carnegie Mellon University.
I work with 
[John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh/) on logic-based Benders decomposition 
and fair allocation of resources.	
I also work with 
[Gerard Cornuejols](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/)
on robust portfolio optimization.	
Previously, I studied at the Industrial Engineering Program of 
Sabancı University. 
My advisors were 
[Nilay Noyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilaynoyan) and
[Kerem Bülbül](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bulbulkerem).
I was affiliated [Smart Mobility and Logistics Lab](http://sml.sabanciuniv.edu/), and
I worked on chance-constrained optimization models for humanitarian 
relief network design.
