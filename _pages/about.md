I work as a research scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/).
I have a PhD in Operations Research from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. 
During my doctorate studies I worked with [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh/) on logic-based Benders decomposition and fair allocation of resources. 
I also worked with [Gerard Cornuejols](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/) on robust portfolio optimization. 

I recently co-authored "The Structure of Fair Solutions: Achieving Fairness in an Optimization Model" (Springer Nature, 2025) with John Hooker and Peter Zhang. The book introduces a new framework for incorporating fairness as a core principle in optimization models, rather than treating it as an afterthought to efficiency-driven approaches.
