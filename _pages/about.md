I work as a research scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/).
I have a PhD in Operations Research from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. 
During my doctorate studies I worked with [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh/) on logic-based Benders decomposition and fair allocation of resources. 
I also worked with [Gerard Cornuejols](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/) on robust portfolio optimization. 

I recently co-authored "[The Structure of Fair Solutions: Achieving Fairness in an Optimization Model](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-82190-5)" (Springer Nature, 2025) with [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh/) and [Peter Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yunz2/). The book introduces a new framework for incorporating fairness as a core principle in optimization models, rather than treating it as an afterthought to efficiency-driven approaches. [Read more about the book](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2025/july/the-new-book-the-structure-of-fair-solutions-reshapes-optimization-by-putting-fairness-first.html).
