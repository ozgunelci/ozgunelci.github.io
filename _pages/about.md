I work as a research scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/).
I have a PhD in Operations Research from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. 
During my doctorate studies I worked with [John Hooker](http://public.tepper.cmu.edu/jnh/) on logic-based Benders decomposition and fair allocation of resources. 
I also worked with [Gerard Cornuejols](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/) on robust portfolio optimization. 

Prior to that, I studied at Sabancı University where I received a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering. 
My advisors were [Nilay Noyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilaynoyan) and [Kerem Bülbül](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bulbulkerem). 
I was affiliated with [Smart Mobility and Logistics Lab](http://sml.sabanciuniv.edu/), 
and I worked on chance-constrained optimization models for humanitarian relief network design.
